## Handling Event Data in PM4PY

 __Importing Data__ 

  PM4PY offers simplified interface to import/export event logs. This provides restricted set of choices in comparison to normal interface moreover PM4PY also provides s simple interface to convert the formats of log data objects.
  
  Find python function which provide simplified interface for __Importing IEEE XES__ and __Importing CSV__ files. 
   
   [Click Here!](pm4pyimportieeexes.pdf) for step-by-step guide for importing IEEE XES files.
   IEEE XES is a standard format describing how event logs are stored. For more information about the format, please study the [IEEE XES Website!](http://www.xes-standard.org/)
   
   [Click Here!](pm4pyimportcsv.pdf) for step-by-step guide for importing CSV files.
   
   
  __Converting Event Data__
  
  In this section, we describe how to convert event log objects from one object type to another object type. the conversion functionality of event logs is located in pm4py.objects.conversion.log.converter. There are three objects, which we are able to 'switch' between, i.e., Event Log, Event Stream and Data Frame objects. Finally, note that most algorithms internally use the converters, in order to be able to handle an input event data object of any form. In such a case, the default parameters are used.
  
  | Variant | Parameter Key | Type | Default | Description|
  |:---|:----:|:---:|:---:|:---|
  |TO_EVENT_LOG|STREAM_POST_PROCESSING| Boolean | False | Removes events that have no type information.|
  | |CASE_ATTRIBUTE_PREFIX|string|'case:'|Any attribute (column in case of DF) with the prefix 'case:' is stored as a trace attribute.|
  | |	CASE_ID_KEY|	string|'case:concept:name'|Attribute (column in case of DF) that needs to be used to define traces.|
  | |DEEP_COPY|boolean|false|If set to True objects will be created using a deep-copy (if applicable). Avoids side-effects (specifically when converting an Event Stream to an Event Log).|
  |TO_EVENT_STREAM|	STREAM_POST_PROCESSING|boolean|false|(Same as TO_EVENT_LOG)|
  | |CASE_ATTRIBUTE_PREFIX|string|'case:'|Any trace attribute (in case of converting an Event Log to an Event Stream object) will get this prefix. Not applicable if we translate a DataFrame to an Event Stream object.|
  ||DEEP_COPY|boolean|false|(Same as TO_EVENT_LOG)|
  |TO_DATA_FRAME|CASE_ATTRIBUTE_PREFIX|string|'case:'|(Same as TO_EVENT_STREAM; will only be applied if input is an Event Log object, i.e., which will first be translated to an Event Stream Object.)|
  | |DEEP_COPY|boolean|false|(Same as TO_EVENT_STREAM)|
  
  __Exporting Data__

  [Click Here!](pm4pyexportcsv.pdf) for step by step guide for exporting CSV files
  
  *Note - At the present time PM4PY works with pandsas libaries to import data.As long as data can be loaded into a Pandas dataframe, PM4Py is reasonably able to work with such files. You can check the files supported by python pandas library [here!](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/io.html)*
  
  __Filtering Event Data__
  
  In PM4PY it possible to filter event data based on following filtering criterias.
  
  1. Filtering event data by time frames.
  
      Find user manual for filtering event data by time frames by pm4py [here!](PM4PYfilteringTimeFrame.docx)
  
  2. Filtering event on case performance / time interval.
   
      Find user manual for filtering event data by case performace / time interval [here!](PM4PYfilteringCAsePerformance.pdf)
   
  3. Filtering events on start activites. 
   
      Find user manual for filtering event data by start activities [here!](pm4pyfilteringstart.pdf)
  
  4. Filtering events on end activites.
  
      Find user manual for filtering event data by end activities [here!](PM4PYfilteringend.pdf)
  
  5. Filtering on varients.
      
      Variants is set of cases that share the same control flow perspective, so a set of cases that share the same classified events(activites) in the same order.
      
      Find user manual for filtering event data by variants [here!](pm4pyfilteringvariants.pdf)
      
  6. Filtering events on attribute values.
  
      Find user manual for filtering event data by attribute values [here!](pm4pyfilteringattributevalues.pdf)
      
  
  7. Filtering events on numeric attribute values.
  
      Find user manual for filtering event data by numeric attribute values [here!](pm4pyfilteringnumericattriburevalues.pdf)
  
  __Process Discovery algorithms in PM4PY__
  
  Process Discovery algorithms want to find a suitable process model that describes the order of events/activities that are executed during a process execution.
  In the following, we made up an overview to visualize the advantages and disadvantages of the mining algorithms.
  
  | Alpha | Alpha+ | Heuristic | 	Inductive |
  |---|---|---|---|
  |Cannot handle loops of length one and length two |Can handle loops of length one and length two | Takes frequency into account | Can handle invisible tasks |
  | Invisible and duplicated tasks cannot be discovered | Invisible and duplicated tasks cannot be discovered | Detects short loops | Model is sound |
  | Discovered model might not be sound | Discovered model might not be sound | Does not guarantee a sound model | Most used process mining algorithm |
  |Weak against noise| Weak against noise |


 
 __1. Alpha Miner and Alpha miner+__
 
  The alpha miner is one of the most known Process Discovery algorithm and is able to find:

   A Petri net model where all the transitions are visible and unique and correspond to classified events (for example, to activities).

   An initial marking that describes the status of the Petri net model when a execution starts.

   A final marking that describes the status of the Petri net model when a execution ends

  __2. Inductive Miner__ 
  
   PM4Py,  offer an implementation of the inductive miner (IM), of the inductive miner infrequent (IMf), and of the inductive miner directly-follows (IMd)    algorithm. The papers describing the approaches are the following:
   
   *Inducitve Miner: [Discovering block-structured process models from event logs-a constructive approach](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.396.197&rep=rep1&type=pdf)*
   
   *Inductive Miner infrequent: [ Discovering block-structured process models from event logs containing infrequent behaviour](http://www.padsweb.rwth-aachen.de/wvdaalst/publications/p761.pdf)*
   
   *nductive Miner directly-follows: [ Scalable process discovery with guarantees](http://www.processmining.org/_media/blogs/pub2015/bpmds_directly-follows_mining.pdf)*

   __3. Heuristic Miner__
   
  Heuristics Miner is an algorithm that acts on the Directly-Follows Graph, providing way to handle with noise and to find common constructs (dependency between    two activities, AND). The output of the Heuristics Miner is an Heuristics Net, so an object that contains the activities and the relationships between them. The Heuristics Net can be then converted into a Petri net.
